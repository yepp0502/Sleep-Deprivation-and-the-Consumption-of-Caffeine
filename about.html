                Sleep deprivation, commonly defined as sleeping less 
                than the recommended eight or nine hours, is increasingly 
                receiving attention as accumulating adolescents. A study was 
                conducted to investigate the effects of sleep deprivation, namely, 
                on high school students' working performance, memory, and mood. However, 
                this website isn't limited to age and those three factors; rather, the calculation
                is for anyone with the suspicion of consuming too much caffeine, which can negatively
                affect any bodily functions.

            <div id="pictext">
                <p id="p2">From the study, it is deducted that sleep deprivation impairs all three
                    factors that ultimately hinder the studies of high school students. 
                    Caffeine is beneficial sometimes in low doses and may reach a plateau 
                    or not give any benefits when consumed daily. However, caffeine is harmful 
                    when consumed in high doses as it raises anxiety. This finding implies that 
                    although caffeine may not be detrimental, it doesnâ€™t help the learning of 
                    high schoolers. That is why it is vital to not be sleep deprived and 
                    depend on caffeine.</p>
